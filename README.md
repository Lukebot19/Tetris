## Tetris

### **Rules:**
Move the blocks around the grid to create a connected line across the grid. If you create a full line, that line is removed from the grid and all the blocks above it move down.

You recieve one extra point every time a new block spawns at the top of the grid. 

The game is over if a new block can't spawn because one of the spawn spaces is already occupied. 

### **Controls:**
#### **Up Arrow:**
Press the up arrow to rotate the block. If the rotation will result in the block going off the edge of the grid or into another block, the block wont rotate.

#### **Down Arrow:**
Press the down arrow to move the block down one square.

#### **Left Arrow:**
Press the left arrow to move the block one space to the left. If this goes off the edge of the grid the block will not move.

#### **Right Arrow:**
Press the right arrow to move the block one space to the right. If this goes off the edge of the grid the block wont move.
